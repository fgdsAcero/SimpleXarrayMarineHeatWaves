# SimpleXarrayMHWs
Scripts to calculate climatological means, 90th (or other) percentiles, and temperature and marine heatwave (MHW) severities based on a desired 30-year baseline historical period.
These scripts are not perfectly calibrated to work with every temperature dataset out there (some variables may need to be renamed). Overall, these scripts may 
provide a useful template for you to use and adjust to suit your needs.

Version 0.9 (Current) Notes:
* The script that calculates climatological means and percentiles does not presently interpolate for NaN values. 

Information to add:
* Where the data comes from
