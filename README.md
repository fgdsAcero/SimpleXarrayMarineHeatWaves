# SimpleXarrayMHWs
Scripts to calculate climatological means, 90th (or other) percentiles, and temperature and MHW severities based on a desired 30-year baseline historical period.

These scripts are not perfectly calibrated to work with every temperature dataset out there; they may serve as a template and be adjusted to suit your needs.
